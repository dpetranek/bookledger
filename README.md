# Bookledger 

Bookledger is a tool for tracking your reading! 

I like to read books. I've been keeping track of what I've read and what I
thought of it in a Google spreadsheet for a few years. It's cool to go back and
see the rate and variety of books that I've read, but the interface isn't
great. I'd like to answer interesting questions and get useful summaries of my
reading material without wrangling spreadsheets. I'd like to know who
recommended which book to me, and when, and how long it took me to get around to
reading it. 

So I'm building this website. It's mainly to practice some stuff I've read
about, but I figure someone else might want to try it. 

## Reading Questions
Here's a list of things that I'm curious about. I hope to create a decent way to
answer them:

- How many books did I read in <time period>?
- What genre do I read the most?
- What author do like the best?
- What books do I keep coming back to?
- What author have I read the most?
- Who has recommended books to me?
- Who's recommendations did I enjoy the most?
- What books have I loaned out? To whom? Since when?
- When do I read the most?
- How have my views on this book? How has that changed over time?
- What do I think of this author? How has that changed over time?
- How many books do I own?
- What is the proportion of unread books to read books in my library?
